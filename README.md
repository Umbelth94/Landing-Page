Landing Page Project

This project is a mokcup of the frontpage of a website. I will be trying to replicate the example website from The Odin Project's assignment from scratch. https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png

In this, I will be putting my HTML and CSS skills to the test. My goal is to finish as much of it as I can without having to look anything up, using any other assignments as references. I will be attempting to use as much proper syntax for the HTML index as I know, but my focus will be mostly on just recreating the different sections of the website through my knowledge of flexbox, the box model, and other styling CSS.

After I have recreated the example to the best of my abilities, I will attempt to find some stock photographs online and fill in some of the text/image placeholders as if the website were for a fake business, and maybe even mess around with some colors.
