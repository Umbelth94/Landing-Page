# Landing-Page
Landing Page Project

This project is a mokcup of the frontpage of a website.  I will be trying to replicate the example website from The Odin Project's assignment from scratch.   https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png 

In this, I will be putting my HTML and CSS skills to the test.  My goal is to finish as much of it as I can without having to look anything up.
